"""
Graham Scan algorithm for finding the convex hull of a set of points.

The Graham scan is a method of computing the convex hull of a finite set of points
in the plane with time complexity O(n log n). It is named after Ronald Graham, who
published the original algorithm in 1972.

The algorithm finds all vertices of the convex hull ordered along its boundary.
It uses a stack to efficiently identify and remove points that would create
non-convex angles.

    Find the convex hull of a set of points using the Graham scan algorithm.

    The algorithm works as follows:
    1. Find the bottom-most point (or left-most in case of tie)
    2. Sort all other points by polar angle with respect to the bottom-most point
    3. Process points in order, maintaining a stack of hull candidates
    4. Remove points that would create a clockwise turn

    Args:
        points: A sequence of Point objects

    Returns:

        Returns an empty list if there are fewer than 3 distinct points or if all

    Space Complexity: O(n) for the output hull
